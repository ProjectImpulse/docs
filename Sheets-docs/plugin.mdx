The Asahi Analysis Toolkit turns Google Sheets into a lightweight research workstation instantly generating research-style writeups, visual charts, portfolio diagnostics, backtests and sentiment analysis from the tickers you already keep in your sheet. Below is a single, complete blog post you can publish that explains the whole plugin workflow (based on your transcript) and uses the screenshots you provided as visual references.

## **Introduction**

If your workflow lives in Google SheetsÂ  a small watchlist, portfolio or a research notebook Asahi lets you go from raw tickers to actionable insights without bouncing between tabs. The plugin reads tickers from a range (e.g., A2:A10) and gives you multiple lenses: written summaries, charts, sentiment dashboards and portfolio-level recommendations. Use this guide to set up a clean sheet, generate analyses, interpret the outputs, and integrate them into your research process.

## **Recommended sheet layout (before you begin)**

Keep a simple, consistent layout so the plugin can detect data reliably:

| **A (Ticker)** | **B (Qty)** | **C (Buy Price)** | **D (Notes)** |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :------------ |
| AAPL           | 10          | 165.00            | Core holding  |

Tips:

- Use one ticker per row and a header row.
- If you plan to track P&L, include quantity and buy price columns.
