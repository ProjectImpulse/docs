**What it does:** Lets you build strategies combining fundamentals, technicals and sentiment; run historical backtests to evaluate returns, drawdowns and trade logs.

**How to:**

1. Choose a preset strategy or create a rule (e.g., P/E \< X and 50-day MA \> 200-day MA).
2. Set timeframe and parameters.
3. Click **Run backtest**.
4. Inspect outputs: cumulative returns, trade list, win ratio, drawdowns.

**Best practices:**

- Start with presets to learn system behavior.
- Run sensitivity tests (change thresholds) to understand parameter robustness.
