**What it does:** Opens a modal with chart tabs: _Fundamentals_, _Peers_, _Valuation_, _Sentiment_. Common charts include revenue/EPS trends, P/E comparisons and word-clouds or term lists for sentiment.

**How to:**

1. Input or select a ticker.
2. Click **Graphs** → **Generate Charts**.
3. Wait briefly (charts can take ~1–2 minutes depending on history).
4. Interact with the modal: change tabs, hover to read values, export visuals as needed.

**Interpretation guide:**

- **Revenue & EPS trends:** Look for direction, consistency and rate of growth — not just one-year jumps.
- **Peer P/E comparison:** High P/E vs peers suggests market growth expectations; low P/E could indicate risk or undervaluation — check margins & leverage.
- **Sentiment charts:** Use counts of terms to estimate signal strength (many positive mentions \> single positive article).

**Visual reference:** _Charts modal — peer P/E comparison._\
