## **1) Write generate research summaries into the sheet**

**What it does:** Creates a research-style paragraph per ticker (fundamentals, growth, profitability, risks, quick metrics).

**How to:**

1. Select the rows that contain tickers (example: A2:A10).
2. Open the **Write** tab in the plugin UI.
3. Choose the target destination column or cell where you want the summaries to go.
4. Click **Write to sheet**.

**When to use:** When you want persistent, editable notes saved in your workbook.

**Pro tip:** Use **Write** after confirming the correct tickers with **View** to avoid accidental overwrites.

## **2) View: read-only research (non-destructive)**

**What it does:** Shows the same content as Write but inside the plugin interface â€” it does **not** modify your sheet.

**How to:**

1. Select the ticker rows.
2. Click **View**.
3. Read or copy the generated summary without altering your spreadsheet.

**When to use:** Fast exploration or QA of generated content before committing changes.
