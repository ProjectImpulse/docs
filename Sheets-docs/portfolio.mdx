**What it does:** Runs a multi-stock diagnostic and returns tabs for _Fundamental_, _Technical_, _Sentiment_, _Research_, and _Trader_ viewpoints. Outputs include per-ticker cards (short rationale + action) and portfolio-level metrics.

**How to:**

1. Enter your portfolio tickers in a range (e.g., A2:A10).
2. Open **Portfolio** → set ticker range → **Analyze portfolio**.
3. Navigate tabs and read per-ticker cards for suggested Actions (Buy / Hold / Sell / Monitor) and risk notes.

**Actionable use:** Use portfolio output to prioritize follow-ups. A card showing **Action: HOLD** + risk summary means “investigate further before changing position.”
