We are building [Kuber](https://openkuber.com) to address a significant gap in the Indian financial management landscape. As university students, we experienced firsthand the frustration of not being able to track our expenses, stick to budgets, and manage investments effectively. We tried multiple apps, but none offered a comprehensive solution. This realization hit us hard during a trip to Goa when we struggled to manage our finances collectively. So we decided to create Kuber, an app that provides a unified platform to track, visualize, and take control of personal finances without the need for additional bank or demat accounts.

The existing financial management solutions in India are limited in scope and functionality. They often require users to open new accounts, which complicates the onboarding process. Moreover, these apps fail to offer a holistic view of personal finances or provide actionable insights. Kuber aims to solve this by aggregating all financial accounts in one place, allowing users to track income and expenses, set budgets, and monitor spending patterns. Our goal is to simplify financial management and make it accessible to everyone, ensuring that users can align their spending with their financial goals.
