[Kuber](https://openkuber.com) is designed to simplify financial management for users in India. It aggregates all your financial accounts' data in one place, making it easy to track income and expenses, set budgets, and monitor spending. Unlike other solutions, Kuber does not require opening a new bank or demat account, making onboarding quick and easy.

Kuber goes beyond basic tracking by offering financial projections and personalized insights. It analyzes your spending trends, predicts future net worth, and shows how your spending decisions affect upcoming payments. The app includes a mood board like interface where you can set and view long-term goals and rules, like how much of your monthly savings should go towards retirement.

Kuber's projection tool maps out an ideal timeline to achieve your goals and compares it to your current timeline based on your spending and saving habits. This helps you understand the impact of your financial decisions, whether you are going over budget or saving less than planned.
