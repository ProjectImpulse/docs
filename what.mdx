## The Problem

Investors are stuck with fragmented data, disconnected tools, and black‑box predictions that fail to explain _why_ markets move. Decisions slow down and hidden risks go unnoticed.

## The Solution

OpenKuber unifies research, testing, and execution in a single platform that surfaces causal drivers   not just correlations   and turns them into probability‑driven strategies.

### What OpenKuber Does

- **Ingests live signals**   financial market feeds plus alternative data (satellite weather, news, sentiment, supply chain telemetry).
- **Discovers causality**   graph‑based causal inference identifies the true drivers of price moves and produces explainable causal scores.
- **Converts to probabilities**   a probability engine translates causal signals into rigorous, tradeable strategies.
- **Executes instantly**   native paper and live rails let you go from insight to execution with one click.

## Technology Highlights

- **AI Research Agents**   summarize filings, interact with datasets conversationally, and inject structured insights directly into analyst workflows.
- **Backtesting Engine**   math‑first, regime‑aware backtests for instant scenario analysis across decades of data.
- **Causal Inference Engine**   automated causal discovery, counterfactual simulations, and attribution for high‑fidelity explainability.
- **Probability & Execution Layer**   converts causal outputs into probabilistic trade signals and routes orders to brokers or paper environments.

## Example   Commodity Fund (Drought → Agricultural Futures)

1. Satellite and local weather feeds stream into OpenKuber.
2. The causal graph highlights drought as a high‑impact driver for specific agricultural futures.
3. The probability engine computes shock likelihoods and shock‑sized distributions.
4. A strategist assembles a hedging strategy and runs instant backtests across multiple historical regimes.
5. With a single click the strategy moves to paper or live execution.

## Why it matters

- **Faster decisions** structured causal signals reduce research cycles from days to minutes.
- **Better risk control** attribute and test drivers rather than guess at correlations.
- **Operational simplicity** one platform for signals, research, testing, and execution.
