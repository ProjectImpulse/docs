This week marked a pivotal moment for us — we started seeing **repeat usage** and **strong PMF signals**, proving that our product is solving a recurring pain in stock research. Building on that momentum, we expanded **Labh Labs**, a campaign that’s rapidly evolving into a **core product direction**.

## 🔁 User Retention & PMF Signal

We observed **repeat users** actively returning to use the plugin for their daily stock research.  

Their feedback highlighted a key outcome **our product reduces friction in research and decision-making.**

- **Outcome:** Strong early signal of **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**.  

- **Learning:** Users find enough recurring value to make it part of their ongoing workflow.
