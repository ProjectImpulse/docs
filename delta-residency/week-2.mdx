title: "Week-2 Delta "
description: "Traction, Pivot, and Labh Labs"
---

This week, our north-star was **traction**. We started with B2B outreach and partnerships, learned fast we lacked leverage there, and **pivoted to social media** doubling down on channels that actually bring users to the product quickly.

---

## 🎯 Focus & Strategic Pivot

- **Main priority:** traction.
- We initially pushed on B2B partnerships because it _felt_ like the right channel, but early signals showed **slow feedback and limited leverage**.
- Early MVP feedback showed promise but taught us we needed faster iteration loops to validate product-market fit.
- Based on what worked faster, we **pivoted to social-first growth** social content, experiments, and community-led showcase formats that let us move quickly and iterate on product & messaging.

> “When speed to signal matters, go where the signals are.”

## 🧪 Labh Labs  what we’re building

We’re building a web app called **Labh Labs**  a live arena for strategy experimentation powered by causal inference.

Core ideas:

- **Compare live strategies**  publish, discover, and compare trading strategies posted by others in one place.
- **Causal-driven tuning** use causal inference to suggest better **time windows** and structural adjustments for a strategy (not just correlation-based tweaks).
- **Bench and learn** reproducible backtest-like experiments framed as causal discovery: measure what _causes_ improvements, not what merely co-occurs.
- Serves as a **showcase and traction engine** for early users and creators.

Think of Labh Labs as a lab bench where creators post strategies and users can meaningfully compare and improve them using causal AI.

## 🐦 Traction via Social early wins

- A single Twitter experiment brought in **15 early users**, validating the **showcase + insight loop** as an effective user acquisition mechanism.
- Iterating on social creative: demo threads, short-form proof clips, screenshots, and shareable highlights that demonstrate functionality.
- Early signals reinforce that social-first strategies provide **immediate traction** compared to slow-moving B2B channels.

---

## 🔁 Learnings & Next Steps

**Key learnings:**

- B2B outreach is valuable long-term, but **social-first campaigns generate early traction fast**.
- Creative iteration and fast feedback loops are crucial for early adoption.
- MVP validation helps identify leverage points and shapes growth strategy.

**Next steps:**

1. Launch a **lightweight Labh Labs MVP** (publish + compare + basic causal suggestions).
2. Scale social experiments attract more creators and seed posts.
3. Convert early social sign-ups into **power users** who become product creators and evangelists.

> Inspired by the motto: **“win big or win nothing”** taking bold bets on social to convert reach into engaged, active users.

_Thanks for following along. Week-2 helped refine our growth strategy, validate early traction channels, and set the stage for turning Labh Labs into a full-fledged product._
