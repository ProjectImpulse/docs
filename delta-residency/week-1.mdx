## 🧱 Setup & Foundations

We kicked off the week by **setting up our blog** — the new home for all things OpenKuber: documentation, tech deep dives, and public delta logs.\
You can now follow along with our product iterations and research updates directly at [blog.openkuber.com](https://blog.openkuber.com).

_Our docs and blog now live side-by-side._

## 🚀 Plugin Launch & Feedback Loop

After applying for **marketplace release**, we gathered feedback from friends and family, refined our UX, and finally **moved the plugin from draft to public**.

We also reached out to **8 ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles)** for more structured feedback — which led to **design changes that are now implemented**. We’re now **moving on to another set of ICPs** for the next round of **iterated feedback and design validation**.

> “User feedback drives clarity — and design iteration is where clarity meets craft.”

## 🤝 Design Partnerships & B2B Outreach

This week, we began **reaching out to RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors)** to explore design partnerships and B2B use cases.

These conversations are helping us shape how OpenKuber can serve financial professionals with precision and depth.

## 🎥 Product Storytelling

We spent time refining our **one-liner** and **elevator pitch**, turning both into short **video showcases** that visually represent our message and intent.

This was also the week we **published our manifesto** — the “why” behind OpenKuber.\
It outlines our ideological roots and long-term vision for democratizing structured financial insight.

A manifesto video is also in the works — designed to make our story more experiential.

## 🧠 Causal AI Development

We formalized our **Causal AI roadmap**, broken into three key steps:

1. **Data Preparation** — already implemented during plugin setup, now fine-tuned for causal discovery.
2. **Causal Discovery** — currently being polished and configured for tighter integration.

3. **Causal Inference** — in planning phase, being mapped out conceptually before implementation.

Each stage moves us closer to an interpretable intelligence layer that goes **beyond correlation — toward cause and effect.**

## 📈 Marketing & Early Reach

We ran a few **Twitter and YouTube experiments** to test early engagement and organic reach — and the numbers look promising.

The focus remains on authentic storytelling and community-driven feedback.

_Thanks for following along. Every week, we’ll share transparent updates as we build in public — step by step._
