Discover how OpenKuber turns Google Sheets into a reasoning-driven stock analytics platform for Indian investors.

### **From Sheets to Smarts**

OpenKuber installs as a simple Google Sheets add-on but functions like a full research desk. Here’s how:

1. **Connect instantly** — one-click install from Google Workspace Marketplace.
2. **Import Indian market data** — real-time BSE & NSE prices, fundamentals, and events.
3. **Apply causal inference models** — find “why” price moved (earnings, macro, sentiment).
4. **Visualize & build dashboards** — create tables, charts, alerts inside Sheets.
5. **Collaborate easily** — share dashboards with teammates or clients.

### **Why It Matters**

Unlike static screeners, OpenKuber evolves with you. It learns patterns, simplifies strategy generation, and keeps your workflow entirely within Google Sheets.
