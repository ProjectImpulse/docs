Compare Trendlyne and OpenKuber for Indian equity research. See how OpenKuber brings reasoning, automation, and Sheets integration to your workflow.

### **Trendlyne vs OpenKuber: Two Approaches to Indian Stock Analytics**

India’s financial research landscape has tools for every niche. **Trendlyne** focuses on detailed equity research, screeners, and financial ratios through its web platform. **OpenKuber** brings that intelligence directly into Google Sheets—turning your spreadsheets into live, explainable trading dashboards.

### **Trendlyne: Deep Data, Static Interface**

Trendlyne is strong on company analytics—quarterly data, ratios, insider trades, and valuation screens. But its dashboards are web-locked; exporting or automating data within your own workflows requires manual steps or premium access.

### **OpenKuber: AI Reasoning Inside Sheets**

With OpenKuber, your workspace _is_ your data platform. You can import NSE/BSE data, run causal inference to see what influenced price movement, and build dynamic dashboards without coding. Everything syncs live inside Google Sheets, so advisors and clients can collaborate seamlessly.
