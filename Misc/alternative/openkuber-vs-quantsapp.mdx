Should you use QuantsApp or OpenKuber? Compare derivatives analytics vs AI reasoning in Google Sheets for Indian markets.

### **OpenKuber vs QuantsApp: Different Depths, Same Goal**

Both **OpenKuber** and **QuantsApp** empower Indian traders—but through very different lenses. QuantsApp specializes in options flow and open interest analytics; OpenKuber brings holistic market reasoning and automation directly to Google Sheets.

### **QuantsApp: Precision for Options Traders**

QuantsApp is a power tool for options data—OI buildup, strikes, market depth. It’s ideal for derivatives traders looking for quick sentiment signals. However, it lacks explainability: you see data but not the underlying cause.

### **OpenKuber: Broader Context, Smarter Signals**

OpenKuber covers cash equities and derivatives while introducing causal inference—linking movements to economic, sectoral, or sentiment triggers. You can analyze “why NIFTY moved” using Sheets formulas and build adaptive watchlists.

| **Feature**  | **QuantsApp**      | **OpenKuber**                   |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Focus        | Options analytics  | Broad market reasoning          |
| Platform     | Web/app            | Google Sheets add-on            |
| Data sources | Derivatives feed   | NSE/BSE equities + macro events |
| Reasoning    | ❌                  | ✅                               |
| Ideal user   | Derivatives trader | Investor, advisor, researcher   |

<Tip>
  If you want deep options flow charts, QuantsApp is solid.\
  If you want to reason about market causality across segments, **OpenKuber** gives you that edge—right inside Google Sheets.
